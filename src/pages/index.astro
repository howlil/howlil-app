              About
            </h2>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              I specialize in building scalable backend systems using JavaScript/TypeScript, Express.js, and Node.js, with strong foundations 
              in cloud infrastructure (GCP) and CI/CD pipelines. While my main focus is backend development, I'm also comfortable with 
              frontend work using React.js and Next.js.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
              I've automated logistics tracking, built reliable remote mentoring platforms, streamlined school operations, and eliminated 
              payment failures in ticketing systems. I've also developed AI-powered security and health tracking solutions, and accelerated 
              product releases through analytics dashboards.
            </p>
            <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Lately, I've been diving deep into DevOps—containerization, networking, operating systems, and Kubernetes. 
              I also enjoy integrating AI/ML into backend projects and building my own ML models. When I'm not coding, I love reading 
              self-development books to continuously grow both personally and professionally.
